# Endnode Transmitter

In this test we use a single rfm95w transmitter to simulate 8 transmitter in series by hopping channels after each sequental transmittion. 

This can than be picked up by a gateway as 8 indidual devices sending at different intervals. For example this test can be used with the `gateway-receiver` test.
